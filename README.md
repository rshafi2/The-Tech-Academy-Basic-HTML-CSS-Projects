Basic Projects for my HTML &amp; CSS Course of The Tech Academy 

This repository contains a set of drills, projects and coding challenges, which were a part of the HTML & CSS Course at The Tech Academy. HTML and CSS are foundational to all web design -- they work together to build and format web pages. It also includes projects and assignments done with Bootstrap which is a free and open-source CSS framework.
